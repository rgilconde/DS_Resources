Example:

selector = FeatureSelector(n_features=20, random_state=314, logging=True)
X_train_selected = selector.fit_transform(np.array(X_scaled))    # equibalent to X_test[:, selector.selected]

print("training data shape: ", X_train_selected.shape)
print("selected feature indices: ", selector.selected)
